# DocuMind_AI ## 📄 Project Overview – DocuMind_AI (Document Q&A App with LangChain)

**DocuMind_AI** is an intelligent document assistant built using **LangChain** and deployed on **Streamlit**. It allows users to upload documents (PDFs, text, etc.) and ask questions about their content. Leveraging advanced language models and retrieval techniques, DocuMind_AI delivers accurate, contextual answers drawn directly from your documents.

This project showcases the integration of **LLMs with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, embedding models, and vector databases — all within an intuitive web app that runs in the browser with zero server overhead.

## 🧠 Key Technologies & Skills Used

### 🐍 Backend & Logic
- **Python** – for orchestrating the app logic
- **LangChain** – to manage LLM chaining, embeddings, document parsing, and prompt templates
- **OpenAI / Groq API** – for fast, high-quality LLM responses
- **ChromaDB / FAISS** – as vector store to enable fast and relevant document retrieval
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** – to ensure answers are grounded in document context

### 🎨 Frontend / UI
- **Streamlit** – for building the interactive web interface
- **Streamlit File Uploader** – to allow document inputs (PDFs, .txt, etc.)
- **Custom Components** – to enhance formatting, feedback, and session state management

### ☁️ Deployment & Dev Tools
- **Streamlit Cloud** – for seamless deployment and sharing
- **Git & GitHub** – for source control and collaboration
- **VS Code** – primary development environment
